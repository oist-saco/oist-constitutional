Dear {name},

CongratulationsðŸŽ‰

You have been **nominated** for the position(s) of **{positions}** of the Student Council.

If you would like to run for this position, **please reply** to this email **by {hustings_date_and_time}** to accept your nomination.

If youâ€™d like to know more about SC affairs, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the current SC officers to ask them questions.

We will hold **Hustings** on {hustings_day}, **{hustings_date_and_time}**. Each nominee is expected to give a **short speech** (max. 2 min) in front of the Student Assembly, expressing why they should be elected, what your experience for the position is, what you want to improve at OIST in the coming year. After all candidates have given their speeches, we will take questions from the current council members and from the Student Assembly. The questions will be unbiased and directed to all candidates running for the same position. The election will take place during the following week.

If you are not available on {hustings_day}, {hustings_date} but still intend to run for the position, please inform the Student Council or me directly ([sutashu.tomonaga@oist.jp](mailto:sutashu.tomonaga@oist.jp)) and let us know.

In addition to the speech, we would like you to **submit a short statement**. Your statement will be published on the Student Assembly website so that students who are unable to attend the Hustings can still have an idea of the candidates' positions. Please send it to me **before the Hustings begin**.


**Note that under the new [ToR](https://groups.oist.jp/sites/default/files/imce/u105953/OIST_SA_Terms_of_Reference_2022.pdf), you may run for two positions!** If you choose to run or think about running for one or two of the positions you were nominated for, please reply to this email.**Not replying will be considered declining**. So, please, only reply if you want to run!


Finally, please carefully read the [Terms of Reference](https://groups.oist.jp/sac/terms-reference) about the position and eligibility for nomination (e.g., the ToR requires a candidate has at least 3 terms remaining in OIST).

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me, [studentcouncil@oist.jp](mailto:studentcouncil@oist.jp), ask on Slack, or reach out to any of the [Officers](https://groups.oist.jp/sac/2024-spring-student-council).


Best,

Simone Tandurella

Student Assembly Constitutional Officer (SACO)
